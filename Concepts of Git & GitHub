GIT: 
Git is a version control system. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained record
of your ongoing programming versions.
Note: Git will only monitor the specified folder/files in the system.

GitHub:
It’s an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer/server.
Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based. 

Version Control:
Version control is like a savings program for your project. By tracking and logging the changes you make to your file or file sets over time, 
a version-control system gives you the power to review or even restore earlier versions. Version control takes snapshots of every revision to your project.
You can then access these versions to compare or restore them as needed.

Git Repository: 
A Git repository is the .git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time. 
Meaning, if you delete the .git/ folder, then you delete your project’s history.

Branch:
A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. 
You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. 
New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.
Note: By deafault git creates master & GitHub creates main.
